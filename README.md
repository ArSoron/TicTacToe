# TicTacToe
This is just a learning project to see if I will be able to implement multiplayer TicTacToe starting from scratch on machine without IDE installed and using unfamiliar technology (SignalR)

Turned out I'm not that good, but I'm still somewhat good. In 3 hours I got everything up and running.. Though without actual game :) Just creating, joining, userstorage, chat, etc.
